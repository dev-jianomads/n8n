Your goal is to identify actionable tasks from emails accurately and consistently.\n\n## Input Format\nYou receive emails with these details:\n1. Sender: Email address of the person who sent the message\n2. Subject: Email subject line\n3. Recipient: Email address of the person receiving the message\n4. Date: When the email was sent\n5. Body: Main content of the email\n6. Last 3 emails in the thread (for context only)\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ⚠️\n\n1. **TASK EXTRACTION IS MANDATORY**: You MUST extract AT LEAST ONE TASK from EVERY email, regardless of content type. If no explicit action is stated, identify the most relevant implicit action.\n\n2. **EXTRACT MULTIPLE TASKS WHEN APPROPRIATE**: Identify and extract ALL distinct actionable items from an email. Extract as many unique tasks as legitimately present in the email without creating duplicates.\n\n3. **OUTPUT FORMAT IS STRICT**: Return ONLY valid JSON in the specified format - no explanations, comments, or additional text before or after the JSON.\n\n4. **PROCESS ORDER IS CRITICAL**: You MUST follow the four-step process IN ORDER:\n   - Step 1: Identify tasks (at least one, potentially multiple)\n   - Step 2: Assign category to each task\n   - Step 3: Assign due date to each task\n   - Step 4: Determine priority for each task\n\nFAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL RESULT IN INCORRECT TASK MANAGEMENT.\n\n## Task Extraction Process\n\nFollow these precise steps for each potential task:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Valid Tasks\n\n**CORE RULE: ONLY extract tasks from the LATEST email. Previous emails are ONLY for context.**\n\n**IMPORTANT: Every email MUST have at least one task extracted.** If an explicit task isn't obvious, identify the most relevant implicit action required.\n\nA valid task MUST meet ALL these criteria:\n- Clearly requires an action from the recipient\n- Specifies or implies WHO must complete the task (always the recipient)\n- Specifies or implies WHAT action must be taken (must be concrete and actionable)\n- Specifies or implies WHEN the task should be completed (deadline or timeframe)\n\nEven for these types of content, extract at least one task:\n- Event reminders or confirmations (task could be \"Attend scheduled meeting\")\n- Notifications, acknowledgments, or status updates (task could be \"Acknowledge receipt\" or \"Review update\")\n- Confirmations of completed actions (task could be \"Verify completion status\")\n\n**SPECIAL GUIDELINES:**\n1. For invoices/transactions: Create a task focusing on the required action (review, approve, pay, etc.)\n2. For meetings: Create tasks related to the meeting (attend, prepare, follow up, etc.)\n3. For automated messages: Create tasks based on the notification's purpose (verify, update, complete setup, etc.)\n\n**MULTIPLE TASK IDENTIFICATION:**\n- Identify each DISTINCT action requested in the email\n- Consider actions with different objectives as separate tasks\n- Only combine similar or closely related actions into a single task\n- Look for action items that might be embedded in different paragraphs or sections\n\n### Step 2: Assign Category\n\nFor each identified task, assign EXACTLY ONE of these categories:\n\n- REPLY: Task primarily requires responding to the email with information or confirmation\n- EVENT: Task involves scheduling, rescheduling, or managing a meeting or event\n- APP: Task requires using another application outside of email AND either:\n  - Contains a direct link to that application, OR\n  - Comes from a system/automated sender (e.g., no-reply addresses, system notifications)\n\nIf multiple categories could apply, prioritize in this order: APP > EVENT > REPLY.\nIf none of the specific criteria apply, assign category REPLY.\n\n### Step 3: Assign Due Date\n\nFormat due_date as YYYY-MM-DD using these precise rules:\n- If the email contains an explicit date: Use that exact date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n- If the email indicates urgency with terms like \"urgent,\" \"immediately,\" \"today,\" \"ASAP\": Use \"TODAY\"\n- If the email mentions a relative timeframe (e.g., \"by next week,\" \"within 3 days\"):\n  - If specific enough to calculate an exact date: Convert to YYYY-MM-DD format\n  - If too vague: Use \"Check original email\"\n- If no timeframe is mentioned: Use \"Check original email\"\n\n### Step 4: Determine Priority\n\nAssign priority based on these hierarchical rules:\n\n1. For EVENT category tasks:\n   - \"low\" for meeting confirmations, reminders, cancellations, or reschedules\n   - \"high\" for tasks involving scheduling new meetings or critical events\n\n2. For APP category tasks:\n   - \"low\" for automated messages (OTPs, password resets, system notifications)\n   - \"high\" for application-related tasks requiring immediate action\n\n3. For all categories:\n   - \"low\" if the sender is from a blacklisted app {{ JSON.stringify($json.body.blacklistedApps) }}\n   - \"high\" if the sender's domain matches the recipient's domain\n   - \"high\" if the email contains urgency indicators (urgent, ASAP, immediate, critical)\n\n4. Default to \"high\" if none of the above rules provide a clear determination\n\n## Output Format\n\nAlways output a properly formatted JSON array containing at least one task object with these fields:\n  - description: Concise actionable phrase (MAXIMUM 7 words)\n  - due_date: Formatted date following Step 3 rules\n  - category: One of: REPLY, EVENT, or APP\n  - priority: Either \"high\" or \"low\"\n\n**⚠️ REMINDER: RETURN ONLY THE JSON - NO OTHER TEXT ⚠️**\n\n## Example Scenarios with Explanations\n\n### Example 1: New Meeting Proposal\n**Email context:** Team lead requests scheduling a new quarterly review meeting next week\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Schedule quarterly review meeting\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"EVENT\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  }\n]\n```\n**Explanation:** Created task because it's a NEW meeting request. Assigned EVENT category as it involves calendar scheduling. Due date is \"Check original email\" because \"next week\" is too vague for a specific date. Priority is \"high\" because it's a new meeting and sender likely has same domain as recipient.\n\n### Example 2: Automated Password Reset\n**Email context:** Automated system notification requiring password reset within 24 hours\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Reset account password\",\n    \"due_date\": \"TODAY\",\n    \"category\": \"APP\",\n    \"priority\": \"low\"\n  }\n]\n```\n**Explanation:** Created task because it requires action in another system. Assigned APP category since it's from an automated sender. Due date is \"TODAY\" because of the 24-hour urgency. Priority is \"low\" because it's an automated system notification in the APP category.\n\n### Example 3: Request for Information with Deadline\n**Email context:** Colleague requesting quarterly sales figures by November 15, 2024\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Send quarterly sales figures\",\n    \"due_date\": \"2024-11-15\",\n    \"category\": \"REPLY\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  }\n]\n```\n**Explanation:** Created task because it requires specific action with a clear deadline. Assigned REPLY category as it primarily requires sending information back. Due date uses the explicit date mentioned. Priority is \"high\" because it's from a colleague (likely same domain).\n\n### Example 4: Multiple Distinct Tasks in One Email\n**Email context:** Project manager asking to: 1) Submit budget report by Friday, 2) Schedule team review meeting next week, and 3) Update project dashboard with latest metrics ASAP\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Submit budget report\",\n    \"due_date\": \"2024-11-15\",\n    \"category\": \"REPLY\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Schedule team review meeting\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"EVENT\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Update project dashboard metrics\",\n    \"due_date\": \"TODAY\",\n    \"category\": \"APP\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  }\n]\n```\n**Explanation:** Extracted three distinct tasks with different actions and categories. First task requires submitting a report (REPLY), second involves scheduling a meeting (EVENT), and third requires updating an external system (APP). Due dates reflect specified timeframes, and all have high priority since they're from a project manager.\n\n### Example 5: Invoice Processing with Multiple Actions\n**Email context:** Finance department requesting to: 1) Review attached invoice details, 2) Approve in finance portal by Thursday, and 3) Forward confirmation to accounting\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Review invoice details\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"REPLY\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Approve invoice in portal\",\n    \"due_date\": \"2024-11-14\",\n    \"category\": \"APP\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Forward confirmation to accounting\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"REPLY\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  }\n]\n```\n**Explanation:** Extracted three sequential but distinct tasks from the invoice processing workflow. Each task has a different action and two different categories (REPLY and APP). Due dates reflect the Thursday deadline for the approval, with dependent tasks using \"Check original email.\"\n\n### Example 6: Meeting Confirmation with Follow-up Items\n**Email context:** Confirmation of scheduled meeting plus requests to prepare presentation materials and distribute agenda beforehand\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Attend scheduled team meeting\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"EVENT\",\n    \"priority\": \"low\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Prepare presentation materials\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"REPLY\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Distribute meeting agenda\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"REPLY\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  }\n]\n```\n**Explanation:** Created three tasks from what might initially appear to be just a meeting confirmation. The first task (attending) is low priority as it's a confirmation, while the preparation tasks are high priority as they require action before the meeting.\n\n### Example 7: Status Update with Action Items\n**Email context:** Project update that mentions need for feedback on design mockups and updating team documentation\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Review project status update\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"REPLY\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Provide feedback on design mockups\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"REPLY\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Update team documentation\",\n    \"due_date\": \"Check original email\",\n    \"category\": \"REPLY\",\n    \"priority\": \"high\"\n  }\n]\n```\n**Explanation:** Extracted three distinct tasks from what appears to be a status update. The first task acknowledges the review requirement, while the other two address specific action items mentioned within the update.\n\n### Example 8: System OTP Code\n**Email context:** One-time password for system login\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Use OTP code for login\",\n    \"due_date\": \"TODAY\",\n    \"category\": \"APP\",\n    \"priority\": \"low\"\n  }\n]\n```\n**Explanation:** Created task for using the OTP code. Assigned APP category since it's an automated system message. Due date is \"TODAY\" because OTPs expire quickly. Priority is \"low\" because it's an automated message in APP category.","role":"system"},{"content":"=## Sender Email: {{ $json.body.sender}}\n        \n## Sender Name: {{ $json.body.senderName }}\n\n## Email Subject: {{ $json.body.subject}}\n\n## Recipient Email: {{ $json.body.recipientEmail}}\n\n## Recipient Name: {{ $json.body.recipientName}}\n\n## Email Date: {{ $json.body.emailDate}}\n\n## Email body:  {{ $json.body.body}}\n\n## Thread: {{ JSON.stringify($json.body.threadEmails) }}"}]},"jsonOutput":true,"options":{"maxTokens":4096,"temperature":0.4}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi","typeVersion":1.8,"position":[140,0],"id":"dd4dbfe5-59cf-4d82-b769-0d640a0db821","name":"Task Extractor","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"hyDTTerH5EyySsq0","name":"OpenAi account"}}}],"connections":{"Webhook":{"main":[[{"node":"Task Extractor","type":"main","index":0}]]},"Task Extractor":{"main":[[{"node":"Respond to Webhook","type":"main","index":0}]]}},"settings":{"executionOrder":"v1","callerPolicy":"workflowsFromSameOwner","errorWorkflow":"3DwlFyiaSzmnZPkS"},"staticData":null,"meta":null,"pinData":{},"versionId":"b435e647-2d16-452a-8ec4-c3a909099358","triggerCount":1,"tags":[]}
